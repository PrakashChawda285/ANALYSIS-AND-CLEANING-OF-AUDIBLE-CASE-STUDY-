📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data cleaning and preprocessing workflow using a large Audible audiobook dataset containing 87,000+ records. The raw data was unstructured and inconsistent, making analysis difficult. Using Microsoft Excel and Power Query, the dataset was transformed into a clean, standardized, and analysis-ready format.

This project highlights how real-world data must be cleaned before meaningful insights can be extracted.

🎯 Objectives
